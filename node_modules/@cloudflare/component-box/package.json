  "description": "Cloudflare Box ComponentThis is styling component similar to cf-component-flex which allows for arbitrary styling. This component should only be used when the built in style doesn't quite fit the bill and when it can't be done with fela. Ideally, cfui components should have the right styling built in for most cases. In the few edge cases that pop up in real world feature development, this is an alternative to wrapping your component in a `<div>` or `<span>` and styling it with css to accomodate one-offs.  Also, note that using Box effectively performs a component level CSS reset, as all props not provided will be pulled from the default theme. These defaults, outlined in propertiesSpec, either match the browser defaults, or are taken from our global styles as defined by cf-style-const.",
